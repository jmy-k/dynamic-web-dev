# week 3: Dynamic Front-end Web Application
### about

when i think of outer space, my mind gravitates toward its immense scale — the vastness of planets, stars, and galaxies. while exploring the nasa image api, i became interested in how these celestial bodies are often categorized by size. this project plays with that idea by drawing somewhat arbitrary connections between space-related keywords and their associated sizes.

i was inspired by constellations — essentially human-made connections between stars — and wanted to create my own "constellation" of sizes.

this project also gave me the chance to experiment with using the html5 `<canvas>` element in javascript. having prior experience with p5.js made the syntax feel familiar and approachable.

- **double-click** on a size to change the background image.  
- the new image is randomly selected from the nasa image api using the size as a keyword.
