# week 1

this is a collage of all things related to the moon - whether through my own personal references or through literal references to the moon.

my name in chinese references the moon, so i have always been particularly interested in all things related.
the finding that sparked the most joy as i was digging for content about the moon is a reference to [Chang'E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e) during the first human exploration of the moon.
you can find the Apollo mission transcript by clicking the Chinese space rover named [Chang'E 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_4) - which was the first ever to explore the far side of the moon.
