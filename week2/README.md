# week 2: Swiss Poster Design
### briefing
Your assignment this week is to design and develop a website about New York using a strong grid drawn from Swiss Poster Design examples.
Your goal this week is to practice defining a grid and ensuring you can layout and position any and every element exactly as you want. This takes a keen awareness and knowledge of CSS layout and positioning, specifically with flexbox.

### about
when i think of NYC, i think of the iconic subway system and its visual language comprised of the helvetica font and many colors. i wanted to reference the grid like structure of the city as well.


i started with some simple black lines that go vertically or horizontally across the page. on scroll down, they will move away from the center. on scroll up, they return to their positions.

to introduce colors, the black lines leave a colored "shadow" on hover. they are offset by a few pixels for effect. i used AI to determine the CSS transition for ```cubic-bezier```, for a bouncy effect as the lines move.

on click, all of the colored lines will disappear.


as more colored lines are added, the text will become more apparent.
